## 🛠️ Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Development Workflow
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables
4. Run tests: `npm test`
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## 📐 Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- Using React Context for state management
- Chose this approach for:
  - Minimal boilerplate
  - Built-in TypeScript support
- Scaling strategy:
  - Separate stores by domain
  - Implement hydration for server-side rendering
  - Use persistent storage for specific states

### Code Structure
```
src/
├── app/            # Next.js pages
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── context/        # State management
└── __tests__/      # Jest test codes
```

- Feature-based architecture for better scalability
- Shared components in `components/`
- State management wit Context in `context/`

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Guidelines
- Test all utility functions
- Test complex business logic
- Test critical user paths
- Test state management logic

### Testing Priorities
1. Critical business logic
2. User-facing features
3. Data transformation functions
4. API integration points

### Test Coverage Goals
- Minimum 80% coverage for business logic
- 100% coverage for utility functions
- Integration tests for critical user flows

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Implemented Optimizations
1. **Code Splitting**
   - Dynamic imports for large components
   - Route-based code splitting


2. **State Management**
   - Selective re-rendering with useMemo/useCallback
   - Optimized context usage
   - Debounced state updates

### Monitoring
- Lighthouse scores tracked
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Performance budgets set
